Fake news stories can be hard to control for several reasons. Many people mistrust established news sources and others just don't read them, so the debunking of a fake story by a serious newspaper or TV channel has limited effect. In addition, the internet is very hard to police. When users are caught misusing one media platform, they simply go to another one or start up a website themselves.
